# Photo Mobile App

The PhotoMobileApp application is a project I developed to apply what I learned. I tried to make an instagram-like app by checking user logins with firebase/Auth. I developed a real-time database project with firebase/FireStore by storing the photos uploaded by users on firebase/Storage. Then I took these photos with SDWebImage and showed them to all users. I've allowed captions etc. to be added to photos. I prevented other users from editing by restricting editing operations on the photo.
